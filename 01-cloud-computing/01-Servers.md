## How websites work
* We as a client, use a network to access servers (websites)
* We use the network to route the packets, the data into the server and we get the response and hence view a website
* Both, **clients** and **servers** have IP addresses... for clients to find the server and server to find the clients

## Server
A Server is composed of:
* **CPU**
    * CPU is responsible for computations 
* **RAM**/**_memory_**
    * The fast _memory_ is responsible for storing information and retrieve it very quickly
* **Storage**
    * Storage to store data
* **Database**
    * To store data in a structured way
* **Networking Devices**
    * Routers
    * Switch
    * DNS server

## Problems on having on-premise servers
* Pay for the rent for the data center
* Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
* Adding and replacing hardware takes time
* Scaling is limited. You need more space to expand your servers
* Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
* Dealing with unexpected obstacles (earthquake, power shutdown, fireâ€¦)
