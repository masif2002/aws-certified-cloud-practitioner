## Cloud Computing
_Cloud computing_ is the **on-demand** delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
* On-demand. Get it when you need it
* pay-per-request pricing
* Provides the ability to provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources. Easy to scale if needed
* Instantly access resources
* Simple UI to access _servers_, _storage_, _databases_ and set of application services

## Deployment Models of the Cloud
* **Private Cloud**
    * Cloud services used by a single organization
    * _Providers_: Rackspace
* **Public Cloud**
    * Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
    * Providers: Micorsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* **Hybrid Cloud**
    * Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud
    * Using a Hybrid Cloud deployment model allows you to benefit from the flexibility, scalability and on-demand storage access while keeping security and performance of your own infrastructure.

## 5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. **On-demand self service**
    * No human interaction from service provider
2. **Broad Network Access**
    * Can be accessed by diverse client platforms
3. **Multi-tenacy and resource pooling**
    * Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
4. **Rapid elasticity and scalability**
    * Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed 
6. **Measured service**
    * Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## 6 Advtgs of Cloud Computing
* **Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)**
    * Pay On-Demand: donâ€™t own hardware
    * Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
* **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
    * Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
* **Stop guessing capacity**
    * Scale based on actual measured usage
    * Usage is tracked and can be scaled (increased) if needed
* **Increased speed and agility**
    * Instant access to extra resources (if needed)
* **No money spent on running and maintaining data centers**

## Problems solved by the Cloud
* **Flexibility**: change resource types when needed
* **Cost-Effectiveness**: pay as you go, for what you use
* **Scalability**: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or
adding additional nodes
* **Elasticity**: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
* **High-availability and fault-tolerance**: build across data centers
* **Agility**: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
